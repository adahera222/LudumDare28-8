# The Game of Fun

I made this game with my kids for the Ludum Dare 28 jam in 72 hours.

This game was written in Haxe and uses the HaxePunk, HaxePunkTmx, and OpenFL libraries.

Graphics were done in Paint.NET, with some of the more pixelated enemies drawn by Burning Wheels in Pixelesque on my phone.

The levels were made in Tiled.

The laser sound was made using BFXR and the title music was made by abundant-music.

This was my first time learning HaxePunk, as I wanted to learn it. If I had known the emitters couldn't do collisions before I started, I would have gotten a lot more done.

A lot of this code is terrible, and for that I am sorry.

Aside from the code, here's what everyone did:

* Burning Tiger (age 8): Drew most level tiles, drew levels. Drew main character. Co-wrote story. Drew the spike enemies, final boss, portal, bone, arrow, grandpa, and probably more.
* Burning Wheels (age 4): Drew some enemies, contributed ideas, required that the Minter Spider "minted" you. Co-wrote story. Came up with the main character's name, which is Jack. Drew the Minter Spider, the ghost, the smusher, and the red ninjas. Drew the mushroom and brick tiles (final level, bottom-left corner), and drew the brick structure.
* My wife: Drew some of the tiles for level 2, because she thought it was fun. Designed some of that level as well, maybe? I'm not sure.
* Me: The grass/dirt blocks (they were supposed to be placeholder but the boys liked them), some animation (ninjas and final boss), and rarely some tweaks to the levels (drawing the right grass blocks at the right angle, implementing some secrets).
